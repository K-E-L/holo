# Welcome to the Holo project! 

Introducing Holo, a next-gen facial recognition method of styling front-end elements! Using the [face-api](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) library, I obtain coordinates of the user's face, a virtual light source, and the element's center to calculate its radial-gradient and shadow. These two attributes were chosen for their malleability as sharp movements / animations based off of facial recognition looks inaccurate and jerky at this point in time. Hopefully in the future these will improve as facial recognition becomes more precise and devices more powerful, being able to run multiple Holo elements without draining battery and limiting performance. I hope you enjoy the Holo project and help push the limits of mode
rn day computing!
